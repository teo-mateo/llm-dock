The last lighthouse keeper on the coast of Mirren had not spoken to another human being in four hundred and twelve days. Elara Voss kept count not out of loneliness, but out of habit, the way one might track the tides or the migration patterns of grey herons. She scratched each day into the wooden beam above her narrow cot with a fish scaling knife, and each morning she woke to the sight of those marks and felt a small satisfaction, like a scientist recording data.

The lighthouse itself was called the Pallid Tower, though no one alive remembered why. It rose from a spur of black volcanic rock at the northernmost point of the island, where the sea turned from deep blue to an unsettling grey-green. The light at its crown was powered by a mechanism that Elara understood only in practical terms: she wound it, she cleaned the lens, she replaced the oil, and every seven seconds the beam swept across twenty nautical miles of open water. Why the intervals were seven seconds and not five or ten, she did not know. The manual, printed in 1937, offered no explanation.

Her days followed a rhythm dictated by the tower. She woke before dawn to check the mechanism. She ate breakfast — usually oats with dried fruit and powdered milk — while reading from the small library previous keepers had accumulated over decades. There were novels in four languages, technical manuals for equipment no longer manufactured, a nearly complete set of encyclopedias from 1962, and, inexplicably, three copies of the same cookbook for French provincial cuisine. After breakfast she walked the perimeter of the island, which took exactly forty-seven minutes at her usual pace. She checked the solar panels, the rain collection system, the radio equipment that she tested daily but that no one ever called on.

The supply boat came every six weeks, weather permitting. A man named Donal from the mainland would anchor in the small natural harbor on the south side and transfer crates of provisions onto the stone dock. He never climbed up to the tower. Their interaction consisted of him waving from the boat and her waving from the dock, and occasionally he would shout something about the weather that the wind would tear apart before it reached her ears. She would find handwritten notes tucked into the supply crates: inventory lists, weather advisories, and sometimes a brief personal message from the coastal authority reminding her that she could request reassignment at any time. She never did.

The truth was that Elara had come to the island not to escape the world but to study it from a fixed point. Before the lighthouse she had been a marine biologist at the university in Carren, specializing in bioluminescent organisms. Her research had stalled not from lack of funding or talent but from what her department chair called an excess of philosophical ambition. She wanted to understand not merely how certain deep-sea creatures produced light, but why light itself seemed to be the universe's preferred method of communication — from photons to fireflies to the beam of the Pallid Tower sweeping endlessly across dark water.

On the four hundred and thirteenth day, something changed. She was conducting her morning inspection of the lens room when she noticed that the beam, rather than sweeping in its usual steady arc, appeared to flicker. Not the mechanical stutter of a failing component — she checked and everything was functioning perfectly — but a subtle modulation, as if the light itself was carrying information she had not put there. She spent the rest of the day observing, recording, measuring. By evening she had filled an entire notebook with observations and had come to a conclusion that she could not yet bring herself to write down.

The light was answering something. Something out in the grey-green water was signaling back, and the old mechanism in the tower, built nearly a century ago by hands that understood more than the manual revealed, was responding. Elara stood in the lens room as darkness fell, watching the beam sweep out and the faint, impossible pulse that came back from the horizon, and for the first time in four hundred and thirteen days she wished she had someone to tell.
